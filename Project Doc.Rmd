Motivation:
 
Being able to properly project and forecast a population’s growth is extremely important in being able to facilitate the distribution of vital resources to a population’s inhabitants. Failure to adequately account for any increases/decreases in population could potentially lead to unintended consequences further along the line. Some noteworthy examples of institutional systems which depend on accurate population projections are social security and retirement, transportation services, education, public services, etc. Upon further investigation, our team came across a research paper written by Peter Pflaumer, professor at the University of Dortmund. Pflaumer’s paper used a combination of Monte Carlo and the Leslie Matrix as a way to project future population. Pflaumer used birth rate, survival rate, net immigration as well as fertility rate, and inputted these values into their corresponding location within the Leslie Matrix.
 
It is worth noting that although this paper utilizes human data, the process and methodology can easily be extended to other species and populations. As long as the aforementioned data regarding the four variables are available for a species, population projections can be derived.
 
Further motivation for attempting to replicate this data is the time period the study was conducted. Published in 1984, the paper claims to have used Monte Carlo simulations in the thousands (100, 1000, 100000). Our team wondered how these simulations could have been performed given the lack of powerful statistical computing available during this era and came to the conclusion that these simulations must have been run over the course of several days (at a minimum). Due to the high likelihood of human error that may have resulted during this study, we wondered whether having more modern statistical software would lead to similar population projections as those obtained in the original study.
 
Our final motivation for conducting and replicating this study is to attempt to extend this process using more up-to-date information via the 2010 census. If the methodology and process described in the paper is indeed a strong predictor of future population figures, then we can use the 2010 Census as a way to forecast future years with more accuracy. The final section of this paper will attempt to create these estimates, although it is worth noting that these estimates can only be verified with the passage of time.

Methodology:
The first topic that must be addressed is the Leslie Matrix and the components within it. A picture of the exact matrix used can be seen on the following page. The matrix furthest to the left contains a single column which represents the next time period’s population, split up into appropriate age bins. This is what is being forecasted, which explains why it is by itself on the left side of the equation. The first matrix to the right of the equation contains some of the previously mentioned variables. The top row is birth rate, which takes into account fertility rate. The distinction must be made between birth rate and fertility rate, with birth rate representing number of live births per 1,000 inhabitants within the population. Fertility rate on the other hand is defined as the average number of children expected to be born per woman in the population. Therefore, total births are calculated as fertility rate, multiplied by the number of women in the population. The birth rate is total births divided by the total population of men and women between the ages of 10-50. This value is then divided by 1,000 in order to be defined in terms of live births per 1,000 inhabitants. Within this same matrix survival rate is placed diagonally, starting with the second row in the first column. This matrix is then multiplied by the current year’s population, split up once again into appropriate age bins. This intuitively makes sense as you would want to multiply the current year’s population by the changes expected to occur regarding births and deaths to forecast future populations. High birth rates combined with high survival rates results in population growth, with the inverse holding true for population decline. The final matrix component to the right of the equation represents Net Immigration, defined as the difference between the immigration and emigration values. Immigration is defined as individuals entering the population from the outside, with emigration being individuals exiting the population. These values are then added to the two previously multiplied matrices to achieve forecasted populations at time period Nkt+1 (The left side of the equation). Also worth noting is that Fertility Rate as well as Net Immigration are random variables, meaning they are drawn at random for each repetition/replication. Once these matrices containing projected future populations for each age bin are obtained (left-side of the Leslie Matrix equation), these values are simulated many times via the  Monte Carlo method. The averages are then calculated, resulting in our final estimated projected population values. Given how the paper utilizes data from the 1982 Census, we will use the same steps within the methodology to extend our results to future years using more up to date information (2010 Census). 

Inverse Transform:

![Pflaumer's Rectangular PDF](/cloud/project/PDF.png)

\[ \begin{cases} 
      2u(-a+m)+a &   a \leq y\leq m \\
      u*2(b-m)+m & m\leq y\leq b \\
      0    \quad otherwise
   \end{cases}
\]

The distribution used by Pflaumer in the study is relatively similar to the uniform distribution. However, he refers to it as a "Rectangular Distribution". The above picture details this PDF. Continuing forward with the piecewise inverse transformation, we first integrated the first piece from "a" to "y", setting the subsequent integral equal to "u". The next step was solving for y. The next step involved integrating the second piece from "m" to "y", once again setting the resulting integral equal to "u". The corresponding piecewise cumulative distribution functions are shown in Latex.

\[ \begin{cases} 
      u = \frac{y}{2(m-a)}-\frac{y}{2(m-a)} &  a \leq y\leq m \\
      u = \frac{y-m}{2(-m+b)} & m\leq y\leq b \\
      0    \quad otherwise
   \end{cases}
\]
